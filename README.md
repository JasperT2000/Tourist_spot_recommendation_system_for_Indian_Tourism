# Tourist_spot_recommendation_system_for_Indian_Tourism

Tourism encompasses leisure and business travel, as well as the theory and practise of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of running tours. People "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes". According to the World Tourism Organization, the tourism is defined as "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only." The main objective of our project is to develop a web application that involves ticket booking system and a recommendation system for different location based on the ratings provided by the users, which will suggest clusters of places that the users may find interesting to visit in general. The ticket booking system will involve bookings of train, bus, flights, and booking of private transport as well.
